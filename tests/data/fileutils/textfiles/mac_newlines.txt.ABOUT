notes: 
 This is code with a complex history as it was also published under a proprietary license at:
 https://web.archive.org/web/20000823095253/http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable2/src/MergeSort.java
 and at:
 https://web.archive.org/web/20000823094850/http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable1/src/MergeSort.java
 and is part of code that was relicensed by Sun following some issues raised many years ago.
 
 The earliest relicense is at
 https://web.archive.org/web/20030709130712/http://java.sun.com:80/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable1/src/MergeSort.java
 
 The detailed history is found foremost in this Mozilla bugzilla:
 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419491and
 And also in Mozilla Rhino history at:
 https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/blob/2c8ae233cda5d6129a140e5572a6dda148afc039/toolsrc/org/mozilla/javascript/tools/debugger/build.xml#L40
 and:
 https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/commit/2e746cd5fb4de9a641b10550909997acb508d324
 
 The gist of this is that all versions prior to Mozilla Rhino prior to
 1.7R1 contained Sun proprietary binary code injected at build time that
 was fetched from code listed above and attached to the article at:
 https://web.archive.org/web/20020520083650/http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/treetable2/
 
 This meant that use of those versions would have required permission
 from Sun (now Oracle) to use and distribute these Sun proprietary
 components. Sun subsequently released and updated the code under a
 BSD style license, and Rhino 1.7R1 and later further vendored the code
 now at:
 https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/tree/6387bac4281ba1c4a8050cd055071615593d214c/toolsrc/org/mozilla/javascript/tools/debugger/treetable
 
 Ironically I am tied to the history of this relicensing somehow as seen
 in comments in at 
 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419491
 
 More details for the posterity: Circa 1998, Sun employees published an
 article with some source code attached. The code was under a Sun
 proprietary license. Circa 2008, at the request of the Mozilla Rhino
 project (which was using that code) Sun relicensed part of that article
 attached code under a new BSD license (as explained in
 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419491 ).
 This code was also already relicensed under an earlier version of the
 article in 2003 under a BSD-style license.
 
 This test file (used for testing line endings on old MacOS) was using
 originally the proprietary-licensed variant.
 This is NOT part of the released commoncode wheels deployed at runetime
 and is not an issue per-se since this code was also licensed by SUN
 under this BSD-style license
 https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/sun-bsd-no-nuclear.html 
  
 This file is therefore updated here to use the
 sun-bsd-no-nuclear-licensed version and will be deleted afterwards as
 this is no longer used in commoncode as the read_text_file() function
 it tested as been removed.
