def flatten(seq):
    """
    Flatten recursively a sequence and all its sub-sequences that can be tuples,
    lists or generators (generators will be consumed): all are converted to a
    flat list of elements.

    For example::

    >>> flatten([7, (6, [5, [4, ['a'], 3]], 3), 2, 1])
    [7, 6, 5, 4, 'a', 3, 3, 2, 1]
